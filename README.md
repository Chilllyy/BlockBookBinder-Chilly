# BlockBookBinder
_A simple utility for preparing and pasting large texts into Minecraft books._

This application was developed in order to make the production of written books in Minecraft easier, by splitting up large texts into pre-formatted chunks that are automatically loaded onto the user's clipboard for pasting into the book.

## Using Block Book Binder

To get started, look for the [**Releases**](https://github.com/andrewlalis/BlockBookBinder/releases) section on this page, and find the latest release. Download the executable JAR file, and make sure you have Java version 17 or higher installed to run it.

Start the program, and you'll be greeted with a window that has **Book Preview** and **Source Text** panels. Enter the text you'd like to work with into the **Source Text** panel. In the top menu under **Book**, you'll find a **Clean Source** button, which will remove extra whitespace from the text to make it more friendly for Minecraft's cramped style. You'll also find **Compile from Source**, which will compile your source text into a book in the **Book Preview** panel.

Once you're happy with how the pages are formatted, you can click the **Export to Minecraft** button to begin exporting pages to your clipboard.
