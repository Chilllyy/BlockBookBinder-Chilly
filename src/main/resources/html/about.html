<h1>About BlockBookBinder</h1>

<p>
    The <em>BlockBookBinder</em> is a simple application that gives you the power to write books faster than ever before! All you need to do is copy and paste some text into the <em>Source</em> panel on the right-hand side of the application, and click <strong>Compile from Source</strong>. Your text will be transformed so that it can fit onto written books in Minecraft, and you can preview the book in the <em>Book Preview</em> panel on the left-hand side of the application, using the navigation buttons below.
</p>

<p><em>
    Note that your text might benefit from the <strong>Clean Source</strong> functionality, where extra new-line and other unnecessary whitespace characters are removed so that the text can be better compressed into Minecraft's limited format.
</em></p>

<p>
    Once you've prepared a book and you want to actually copy it into Minecraft, click on <strong>Export to Minecraft</strong>. This will open up a popup with a few different buttons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Auto-paste</strong>: When checked, the program will automatically press CTRL+V and click your mouse to insert pages into the book, so that you don't need to do anything. If you select this, don't forget to move your mouse so that it's hovering over the <em>next page</em> button in Minecraft, otherwise auto-pasting won't work properly.</li>
    <li><strong>First Page & Last Page</strong>: These inputs allow you to select the range of pages to export. Because Minecraft written books are limited to <strong>100</strong> pages only, this range cannot exceed that amount. Both the first and last page are included in the range.</li>
    <li><strong>Auto-Paste Delay</strong>: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait between the various actions required for auto-pasting. If your server is experiencing a lot of lag, consider bumping this up to at least 1 second. The default value should be fine for most cases, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After setting any options that you want to, go ahead and press <strong>Start</strong>, and navigate back to your Minecraft window. You should hear ten <em>beep</em> sounds before exporting begins. If you selected auto-paste, you must make sure your mouse is hovering over the <em>next page</em> button in your written book before the ten seconds are up.
</p>

<p>
    Once those first ten seconds pass, the first page will be loaded into your clipboard, and if auto-paste is enabled, automatically pasted into the book in your game. If auto-paste is not enabled, you'll need to manually paste each page, and then turn to the next page. You can see your progress in the popup, along with any important status updates as exporting progresses.
</p>

<p>
    When all pages have been exported, you'll be prompted with a little popup, after which the export popup closes and you have the option to export again, or simply close the application if you're done.
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
    This program works by hijacking your PC's input system to automatically transfer text to the system's clipboard, and then paste it by pressing <em>CTRL+V</em> for you. Because of the nature of such applications, there's no guarantee that this process will work on every computer. Here are some tips to try and get things working.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Try to increase the auto-paste delay to 1 second or more, if you notice some pages being skipped during the export process.</li>
    <li>If the automated approach fails, you can always select and copy each page from the book preview.</li>
</ul>
